# Classification with Decision Trees and Random Forest

# Example 11
Use the Wine dataset (distributed with Scikit-learn) to build a model which predicts wine quality class from other measured features. Report the accuracy score in train and test sets. Use repeated cross-validation with test size 30 %. Compare the accuracies of the following models: a) Decision tree with max depth 3. Also plot the tree. b) Random forest with max depth 3.

# Example 12
The dataset covtype.csv shows forest types classified into 7 categories. Build a machine learning model which predicts the forest cover type based on other measured features. Compare the accuracies of 2 models:

a) Decision tree with max depth 3. Also plot the tree.

b) Random forest with unlimited max depth.

Use repeated cross-validation with test size 30 % in order to give more confidence to your accuracy estimates.
